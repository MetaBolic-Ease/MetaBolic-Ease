# ðŸ”’ Data Flow and Security

### Data Sources and Stakeholders

* **Patient**: Provide initial data through questionnaires, self-reported metrics, and wearable devices.
* **Healthcare Providers**: Share data from EHRs, diagnostic reports, and treatment plans via ABDM integration.
* **Diagnostic Labs**: Upload biomarker testing and advanced diagnostic results securely.
* **Medical Devices**: Integrate with body composition analyzers, CGM systems, blood pressure monitors, and other devices.
* **Wearable and IoT Devices**: Collect real-time data on activity levels, sleep patterns, heart rate, and other health metrics.
* **Mapping and Measuring Tools**: Incorporate data from food intake tracking apps, GPS tracking apps, and environmental sensors.

### Data Ingestion Flow

1. **Data Collection**:
   * Patient-Entered Data
   * Healthcare Provider Data
   * Diagnostic Lab Data
   * Medical Device Data
   * Wearable and IoT Device Data
   * Mapping and Measuring Tool Data.
2. **Data Reception and Parsing**:
   * Parse data into structured format
   * Decode device-specific data formats
   * Use FHIR or OpenEHR standards to harmonize data.
3. **Data Validation and Cleaning**:
   * Implement SodaCL checks for data quality
   * Validate data against predefined rules and constraints
   * Flag and correct or discard inconsistencies and errors.
4. **Data Transformation and Enrichment**:
   * Transform data into suitable format for analysis and modeling
   * Enrich data with additional information from external sources.
5. **Data Storage**:
   * Securely store standardized and validated data
   * Implement data privacy and security measures.
6. **Data Analysis and Modeling**:
   * Use Apache Airflow to orchestrate data processing and analysis workflows
   * Apply AI/ML algorithms to generate insights and personalized recommendations
   * Develop predictive models to assess risk factors, predict treatment outcomes, and personalize interventions.
7. **Data Visualization and Reporting**:
   * Present data in user-friendly visualizations and reports
   * Enable patients and healthcare providers to track progress, monitor health metrics, and make informed decisions.

### Technical Considerations

* **API Integrations**: Integrate with APIs from ABDM, healthcare providers, diagnostic labs, and third-party apps and tools.
* **Data Streaming**: Implement a streaming data architecture for efficient processing and analysis of real-time data from wearable and IoT devices.
* **Scalability**: Design the platform to handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally as needed.
* **Security**: Implement robust security measures, including encryption, access control, and data anonymization, to protect sensitive patient information.
